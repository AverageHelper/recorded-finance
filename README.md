# Recorded Finance

A Svelte app for managing monetary assets. All data is encrypted client-side and stored on a server that you control.

### Alternative Projects

There are many open-source balance keepers out there, but none I've found that I quite like. A few are listed [here](https://opensource.com/life/17/10/personal-finance-tools-linux).

### The Goal

The aim of this project is to be a cross-platform and portable place to keep personal financial records. There will always be a way to self-host the storage server, and I intend for this project to always be open-source.

## Setup

### Prerequesites

To run the app in your browser, you'll need one of the following browsers and versions:

- Chrome >=87
- Firefox >=78
- Safari >=14
- Edge >=88

(I've not tested any of these boundaries, but [Vite.js recommends them](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#browser-compatibility).)

Developing for this project requires Node 16.5 and NPM v7 or above. You can check what versions you have installed by running `npm -v` and `node -v`:

```sh
$ npm -v && node -v
8.1.2
v16.13.1
```

### Compile and Run the Server

See [the server's README](/server/README.md) for info on that.

<!-- TODO: Add a note here about our own hosted solution -->

### Compile and Run the Client

- Clone the repository
- Create a .env file at the root of the project, like the one shown below:

```sh
# .env

# Where your server lives (optional for Vercel, required with self-hosted instance)
VITE_PLATFORM_SERVER_URL={your storage server URL}:3000

# Enables the "Login" menu item (optional, defaults to "true")
VITE_ENABLE_LOGIN=true

# Enables the "signup" behaviors (optional, defaults to "false")
VITE_ENABLE_SIGNUP=false

# Optional if the back-end runs on Node, required with Vercel
VITE_PUBNUB_SUBSCRIBE_KEY={your subscribe key from PubNub}
```

If you're hosting the storage server on the same machine that hosts the Recorded Finance web client, do NOT use `localhost` for the `VITE_PLATFORM_SERVER_URL`. You must set this to a URL that _clients_â€”that is, web browsersâ€”can use to access your back-end.

Using `localhost` for this will cause clients to try _themselves_ as the storage server, and that's usually not what you want.

```sh
$ cd recorded-finance       # Be in the root directory
$ npm ci                      # Install dependencies
$ npm run build:client:quick  # Compile the client
$ npm run dev:client          # Start a local webserver
```

> Note: The build script injects your .env values at build time. If you must change .env, remember to re-build the client.

The webserver will print a URL in your terminal to paste into your browser. It should look something like [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173). Give that a go, and you're off to the races!

I recommend you deploy the client (the contents of the `recorded-finance/dist` folder) on a webserver like [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/).

DO NOT FORGET your ACCOUNT ID or PASSWORD. If you do, your data is irretrievably lost. That data is encrypted, and can only be retrieved using those details. You have been warned. :)

## FAQ

Some questions I've asked myself while developing this. You might have these questions too!

### Why use cookies?

JavaScript is not a safe spot to store cookies. Nascent versions of our front-end client stored the user's login token in a JavaScript variable. I later learned a better way: don't handle the token myself, let the browser handle it with [standard cookie security APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#restrict_access_to_cookies).

Our storage server still responds to successful login requests with the token in the response body, but the server also now asks requesting clients to set the token as a cookie with the following attributes:

- `HttpOnly` - According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#restrict_access_to_cookies): "A cookie with the HttpOnly attribute is inaccessible to the JavaScript [`Document.cookie`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie) API; it's only sent to the server. For example, cookies that persist in server-side sessions _don't need to be available to JavaScript_ and should have the `HttpOnly` attribute. This precaution helps mitigate cross-site scripting ([XSS](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Types_of_attacks#cross-site_scripting_(xss)>)) attacks." (emphasis mine)
- `Secure` - Not set if the server is running on `localhost`. According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#restrict_access_to_cookies): "A cookie with the Secure attribute is only sent to the server with an encrypted request over the HTTPS protocol."

If you create your own client to use against our hosted storage server, please don't mishandle the auth token. If you dig back in our git history to find and use a version that uses the old JavaScript-based auth method, know that you may be getting into avoidable security vulnerabilities.

### Why disclose cookies?

I've heard that GDPR doesn't care about "session" cookies, and therefore don't need to be disclosed.

While our cookies indeed deal with the user's login "session," [GDPR.edu](https://gdpr.eu/cookies/) defines "session cookies" as cookies that "are temporary and expire once you close your browser (or once your session ends)." Since our cookies persist between browser sessions, I need to disclose them.

`Secure` cookies are also hidden to most browsers' devtools. (I might post screenshots later of what I mean by this). This means that most users won't see our cookies on their browser. However, our cookies are not set with the `Secure` attribute if the login request comes from an HTTP source, such as `localhost`. These cookies _will_ appear in some browsers' devtools. To avoid confusion, and as a point of principle, I want to make clear to savvy users what's happening here.

### How do releases work?

The manual way is complicated: add a version entry to [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md), straighten out the not-yet-valid URLs in the changelog footer, update [package.json](/package.json) and [package-lock.json](/package-lock.json) (the latter using `npm i`), then merge the PR, then copy the changelog entry to cut a new [Release](https://codeberg.org/RecordedFinance/recorded-finance/releases) and tag using Codeberg's UI. The changelog's version links now point to the relevant newly-created tags.

I've missed some steps before. For example, version [0.9.0](/CHANGELOG.md#090---2022-07-12) didn't originally have a tag, so related comparison links were broken. Not ideal. Since we use [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), we can automate most of our release steps, as follows:

1. I create a version entry in [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md). If I'm ready to merge to main but not yet ready to cut the release, I call the version `"Unreleased"`, and the tooling ignores that version.
2. When I'm ready to cut the release, I rename `"Unreleased"` to the next [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)-appropriate number.
3. I run `npm run release`, which fixes the changelog's footer links and the `version` fields in [package.json](/package.json) and [package-lock.json](/package-lock.json).
4. I push a PR.
   - The CI (Continuous Integration) bots check that there's a new version in the changelog, and if so, check that I've run `npm run release` on the branch. (The usual CI checks also occur.)
5. I merge the PR.
   - The CD (Continuous Deployment) bots dispatch a new git tag and Forgejo Release using the content of the [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md).

Once the release is tagged and deployed, it's up to server maintainers (including me) to pull down the latest changes. I might do something about that later.

### Analytics?

Google Analytics is spoopy as heck, and even [illegal in the EU](https://noyb.eu/en/austrian-dsb-eu-us-data-transfers-google-analytics-illegal). Right now, we don't have any analytics at all. We're considering respectful options:

- [Fathom](https://usefathom.com)
- [Simple Analytics](https://www.simpleanalytics.com)
- [Matomo](https://matomo.org)
- [Plausible](https://plausible.io)
- [Piwik](https://piwik.org)

### Roadmap?

I have a long wishlist for this project. In no particular order:

- [x] Move repo to our own GitHub org
- [x] [Switch to Codeberg](https://giveupgithub.org)
- [ ] Move repo to our own Forgejo instance
- [ ] Separate the "website" from the "app" to make self-hosting easier
- [ ] Standard API evolution protocol (deprecation and obsoleting of old API versions)
- [ ] API v1
- [ ] Detailed documentation webpage (protocols, API, etc.)
- [ ] SDK for third-party tools to participate in our hosted E2EE data access without needing to re-implement the correct protocols directly
- [ ] Logo
- [ ] Mobile apps (?)
