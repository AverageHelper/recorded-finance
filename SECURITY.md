## Reporting a Bug

Thank you for improving the security of Recorded Finance!

If you discover a security vulnerability in Recorded Finance, please disclose it by [drafting a security advisory on our GitHub](https://github.com/RecordedFinance/recorded-finance/security/advisories/new). (We have since moved primary operations to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/RecordedFinance/recorded-finance), and are working on an alternative reporting site.) Alternatively, you may email <security@recorded.finance> ([PGP public key](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/B538EC90D2E4A997E4EE3852B673552B3C21FBCE)). I do not yet have a way of paying out bounties for bugs, but I expect to have one set up once this project is profitable.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.
