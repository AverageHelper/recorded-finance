## Reporting a Bug

Thank you for improving the security of Recorded Finance!

If you discover a security vulnerability in Recorded Finance, please disclose it via [our huntr page](https://huntr.dev/repos/averagehelper/recorded-finance). Bounties, CVE assignment, response times, and past reports are all there, or will be there following the first report.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.
